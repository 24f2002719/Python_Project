# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Python.  
The program randomly selects a number within a user-defined range, and you have to guess the number in the minimum number of attempts possible (calculated using binary search logic).

---

## âœ¨ Features

- User specifies the start and end of the range.
- The program randomly selects a number within the given range.
- Minimum number of guesses required is calculated using binary search principle (`logâ‚‚(range size)`).
- After each guess, the user receives feedback:
  - Whether the guess is **too high** or **too low**.
  - If the guess is correct, the program **congratulates** the user and displays the number of attempts taken.
  - If the user fails to guess within the minimum number of attempts, the correct answer is revealed.
